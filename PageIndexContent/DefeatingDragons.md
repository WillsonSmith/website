Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that
dragons exist, but because they tell us dragons can be beaten.

Fairy tales show us dragons can be defeated, well crafted user
experiences show us that difficult tasks are surmountable.

Shopify merchants face dragons every day. They are the dragons of a
new business, of a new idea, of a new product. The dragons of a new
market, a new customer, a new competitor. Technology and the world
around us change every day and adapting to every change while
building a business is hard. My goal was to provide them with the
tools to slay their own dragons.
