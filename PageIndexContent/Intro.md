Hey! I'm **Willson**, a software developer with a
specialization in front-end web experiences.

I'm a former Shopify employee of 8 years. Prior to my leave, my
title was **Senior Creative Technologist**. I wore many
hats during my time at the company, but they shared a common thread:
building bridges between people and technology.

I was a front-end developer, a UX developer, a creative
technologist, but through all these roles my goal was simple: build
delightful, productive, and inclusive experiences for our merchants.

In addition to building the front-end Shopify admin experience, some
of my responsibilities included: working with designers to find the
balance between possible and perfect, educating my team on the best
use of and contributing to Shopify's Polaris design system, and
building prototypes to help communicate ideas.
