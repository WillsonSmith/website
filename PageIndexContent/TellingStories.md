Stories are integral to the human experience. They are how we make
sense of the world, how we communicate ideas, how we teach, how we
learn, and how we remember.

I believe that the best user experiences are the ones that tell a
story. They are the ones that guide you through a journey, they do
not leave you behind, they do not leave you confused, they do not
leave you frustrated. They make you promises and they keep them.

Stories are also delightful, they are fun, they are engaging, they
are memorable. They are the experiences we remember, the ones we
tell our friends about, the ones we come back to. I want to tell
those stories.
