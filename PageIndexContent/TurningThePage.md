I've wrapped up my time at Shopify but I am not done building great
experiences. Front-end development has always foremost been a hobby
and passion, I take pleasure in building the web. I love it. The
challenge, the problems I get to solve, the sheer amount of learning
and creativity to be had.

For the time being I'm taking some time for me. I'm learning new
skills and working on some personal projects and I'm finding new
ways to connect people, and more ways to tell stories.
