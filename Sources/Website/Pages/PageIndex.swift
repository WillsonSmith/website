    <p>
      Hey! I'm <strong>Willson</strong>, a software developer with a
      specialization in front-end web experiences.
    </p>

      <p>
        I'm a former Shopify employee of 8 years. Prior to my leave, my
        title was <strong>Senior Creative Technologist</strong>. I wore many
        hats during my time at the company, but they shared a common thread:
        building bridges between people and technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a front-end developer, a ux developer, a creative
        technologist, but through all these roles my goal was simple: build
        delightful, productive, and inclusive experiences for our merchants.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to building the front-end Shopify admin experience, some
        of my responsibilities included: working with designers to find the
        balance between possible and perfect, educating my team on the best
        use of and contributing to Shopify's Polaris design system, and
        building prototypes to help communicate ideas.

      <p>
            Stories are integral to the human experience. They are how we make
            sense of the world, how we communicate ideas, how we teach, how we
            learn, and how we remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that the best user experiences are the ones that tell a
            story. They are the ones that guide you through a journey, they do
            not leave you behind, they do not leave you confused, they do not
            leave you frustrated. They make you promises and they keep them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stories are also delightful, they are fun, they are engaging, they
            are memorable. They are the experiences we remember, the ones we
            tell our friends about, the ones we come back to. I want to tell
            those stories.

            around us change every day and adapting to every change while
            building a business is hard. My goal was to provide them with the
